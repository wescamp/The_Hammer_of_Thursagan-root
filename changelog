0.1:
	* Initial release

0.2, 0.3:
	* Code identical to 0.1, these were tests for the upload code.

0.4:
	* Not putting villages omn the map edge banishes a hang bug that had
	the following symptom: "error engine: Cannot create unit:
	location is not on map, and player 5 has no recall list."

0.5:
	* Add changelog (good suggestion by turska)
	* Fixed recall of Aiglondur to work right if he leveled up.
	* Minor textual changes suggested by Turin Turambar.

Known bugs:
	* Villages should not pop up bandits when they're captured
	while held by the dwarves or orcs.  Recapture by the bandits
	should enable the village to spout bandits.  Right now this
	doesn't work right.

	* Invaders (scenario 5) is probably too easy. Just staying 
	out of the way while the orcs and bandits slaughter each other
	seems too effective a way to win it.
