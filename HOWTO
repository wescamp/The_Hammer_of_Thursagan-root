This is a HOWTO on writing campaigns that I'm developing by writing
The Hammer Of Thursagan.

1. Storyboarding

First, *write your storyline*.  Battles may be the center of BfW, but 
writing an interesting storyline and designing battles to fit works better
than designing battles and then wrapping a story around them.  

So, start by writing a storyboard of your campaign.  The storyboard should
contain a section for each scenario, beginning with its title and continuing
with the story text and dialogue.  The storyboard should also include a 
description of the map and the kind of battle you want to have.  It should
describe any special events in the scenario, how they may fire, and what the
effects are.

Here is an example of a storyboard section from The Hammer Of Thursagan.
Most storyboards section are shorter than this; I chose an complex one 
to give an idea of the range of things you may want to do in a storyboard.

    Scenario 6: High Pass

    Angarthing: Behold, the High Pass.  By the old maps, we are halfway to
    Kal Kartha here. 

    Aiglondur: We must push through quickly; there is a vicious storm
    coming in behind us.  Being caught in a blizzard on those heights
    would be no laughing matter.

    The map should be a twisty, narrow path through rugged snow-capped
    mountains.  The objective will be to get Aiglondur through to the
    other side.  The opponents will be gryphons, wolves, and the elements.
    We should try to get creative with representing the effects of extreme
    cold, perhaps something like the dehydration effect in UtBS.  And the
    time-limit should be tight.

    There should be a village near the midpoint of the pass.  When the players 
    occupy it, a Red Mage named Ratheln will appear.

    Ratheln: Hail, I am Ratheln.  If you're traveling down the pass,
    please take me with you.  I am near freezing and starving to death up
    here.

    Angarthing: Pardon my curiosity, but what is a firemage doing freezing to 
    death?

    Ratheln: In case you haven't noticed, there is a serious shortage of
    both firewood and food in this gods-forsaken slot.  And the damned
    gryphons descend on me whenever I stir out of this shack.  I've
    had nothing to eat but flash-roasted gryphon for the last three
    weeks.

    Aiglondur: Where were you bound when you got stuck here?

    Ratheln: There is a school of mages near the east end of the pass.
    They've an opening for an instructor, and they're expecting me.

    Angarthing: Let's take him with us, Aiglondur.  We know little
    about the country beyond to the east; we've had few reports on it
    since before the orcs took Knalga.  Those mages should know at
    least rumors.

    Aiglondur: Aye.  And I'd not leave anyone who had done my kin no harm
    stranded to starve.

    On victory:

    Aiglondur: We're through the pass!

    Angarthing: That may not be a blessing. Something frightened those
    orcs enough to make them push west into Alliance territory.  Don't you
    wonder what it was?

    Aiglondur: Aye.  But I've a grim feeling we might be going to 
    discover that in person.

    On halfway through the turns:

    Aiglondur: It has begun to snow.  Move, everyone!  To be trapped here 
    would be death.

    On time out:

    Aiglondur: We're snowed in.  Our mission has failed, even if we live.

The WML for THoT::High Pass doesn't exactly match this; I added ogres and 
woses as possible enemies, and some of the dialogue has changed a little.
Your storyboard should be a support, not a straightjacket; its function 
is to help you focus on storyline composition without being distracted
by WML and implementation details.

2. Tips for good storyline writing

A good storyline is not just a series of incidents hanging in the
void.  A good storyline has continuity within itself and connections
to the rest of the world of Battle For Wesnoth.

Use place names.  "Behold, the High Pass...we are halfway to Kal Kartha".
You create a sense with these that the story is *situated*; the 
landscape means something to the characters, and the reader is invited
into their world of meanings.  It's even better when you can use a place 
name on the main Wesnoth map; this ties the campaign to the known world.

Use calendar references that situate the campaign in the Wesnoth timeline.  
The intro for the first scenario of THoT ends like this:

    But the threat from hostile orcs, wild men, and remnant undead was not
    yet ended.  The dwarves kept strong guards on the approaches to
    Knalga. In the year 550 after the founding of Wesnoth, the captain of
    the East Gate received a warning that a small band of rogue orcs
    had been sighted.

This is a story hook.  We know where it happens, we know when, and we've
introduced our first character: the (not yet named) captain of the East
Gate of Knalga.  The first speaking lines in the scenario are his.

Use foreshadowing and back references to create continuity. In our
storyboard for High Pass: "There is a school of mages near the east
end of the pass."  This is a really simple form of foreshadowing; the
player is quite likely to think "School of mages?  Cool! I hope I get
to see it in next scenario."  You've given the player something to
anticipate -- and when he *does* actually see that school in Mages And
Drakes (scenario 7), you'll have created a continuity, a bit of thread
that ties High Pass together with Mages And Drakes.

"Something frightened those orcs enough to make them push west into
Alliance territory" -- that's a back reference to the action of
scenario 5, "Invaders".  By writing this, we give that scenario a
meaning it didn't have before; we tie it to the present of the
characters in High Pass.  This is another kind of continuity, making
the story stronger.

Develop characters. Look at this again:

    Ratheln: In case you haven't noticed, there is a serious shortage of
    both firewood and food in this gods-forsaken slot.  And the damned
    gryphons descend on me whenever I stir out of this shack.  I've
    had nothing to eat but flash-roasted gryphon for the last three
    weeks.

We get a good sense of what Ratheln is like from this -- gruff, sarcastic, 
and the kind of tough that will tear into a gryphon carcass with his 
teeth if he has to.  Not a guy to be idly messed with. Players will
remember this bit; the whole campaign just got a little more interesting.

Don't go overboard with character development. A lot of writers have
been taught to believe that stories stand or fall on the quality of
their characterization.  This ain't necessarily so even in general,
and in the very tight constraints of Battle For Wesnoth storylines,
it can lead you into overwiting.

Even a hundred words of dialogue is pretty talky in a BfW scenario, and
you have to budget a lot of that for plot.  You can't afford to spend
lots of verbiage on characterization, which means every bit you do
has to count.

3. Flow, Climax, and Story Arcs

The basic trajectory of a Wesnoth campaign should work like the basic
trajectory of any story -- a building-up of tension, followed by a
climax, followed by a wrap-up or resolution (writers call this the
"story arc").  So simply for narrative reasons, early scenarios should
be easy and later ones progressively more difficult.  In Wesnoth,
of course, this is also necessary because each scenario has to be matched 
to the rough number of veterans you expect your player to have 
when it starts.

In Wesnoth, an explicit resolution often takes the form of a single
talk-only Epilog scenario.  From a strictly gaming point of view
there's no point to an Epilog because there's no battle; it's very
much there to finish the story.

Long campaigns may actually have two or even three story arcs in
sequence, all fitting into a single over-arc in which earlier
sub-stories build up tension for the final resolution.  For example,
in The Rise of Wesnoth (a *very* well-written campaign that repays
careful study) there are three story arcs.  One finishes with
Haldric's departure from the Green Isle, the second finishes when
Haldric sits down to negotiatiate with the elves of the Great
Continent, and the third one climaxes with the final battle

Another important rhythm is this: as you build up tension, alternate 
easy with hard scenarios.  This makes good story -- Tolkien relied
on it heavily in plotting Lord of the Rings -- but there is a specific
tecnical reason to do it in Wesnoth: gold control.  We'll talk about
this more when we describe balancing techniques.

When you write your storyboard, it's a good idea to note which
scenarios open, climax, and (if applicable) resolve each story arc,
Also, note which scenarios are intended to be easy and which hard.
That way you'll notice when you have two hard or two easy scenarios
adjacent and get a good clue about something that might need fixing.
